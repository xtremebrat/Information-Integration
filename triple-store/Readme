Program that runs a dbpedia sparql query for all the private universities in California and created a local triple store from those results.
Triple store quried locally to obtain the colleges within 200 miles from UCLA.
List is saved in a file.

This was the query that retrieved all private universities in California:
PREFIX dbpedia-owl: http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ PREFIX dbpedia: http://dbpedia.org/resource/ PREFIX geo: http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos# PREFIX rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# PREFIX rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# SELECT DISTINCT ?University ?City ?lat ?long
WHERE
{
{
?univ
dbpedia-owl:type dbpedia:Private_university;
dbpedia-owl:city ?ci;
rdfs:label ?University;
dbpedia-owl:state dbpedia:California.
?ci rdfs:label ?City.
FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG(?University), "en"))
FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG(?City), "en"))
OPTIONAL {?univ geo:lat ?lat }
OPTIONAL {?univ geo:long ?long
}
}
}
The cases where some universities did not have values for latitude or longitudes were handled by using OPTIONAL.
In java the query string was created like this:
String queryString = "PREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n"
+ "PREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n"
+ "PREFIX geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>\n"
+ "PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n"
+ "PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n"
+ "SELECT DISTINCT ?University ?City ?lat ?long\n"
+ "WHERE { { ?univ\n"
+ "dbpedia-owl:type dbpedia:Private_university;\n"
+ "dbpedia-owl:city ?ci;\n"
+ "rdfs:label ?University;\n"
+ "dbpedia-owl:state dbpedia:California.\n"
+ "?ci rdfs:label ?City.\n"
+ "FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG(?University), \"en\"))\n"
+ "FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG(?City), \"en\"))\n"
+ "OPTIONAL {?univ geo:lat ?lat }\n"
+ "OPTIONAL {?univ geo:long ?long } } }";

How the Program works:
- Sesame was installed and a local repository was created.
- Obtained data from DBpedia. Used the query shown above and obtained the data from dbpedia and stored it in a file called output.txt, in a folder called data in the workspace. Used Jena to execute the query.
- Utilizing the appropriated properties from Schema.org, the data was converted and stored as turtle triples in the repository using CONSTRUCT.
- Executed the local query to the repository and carried out the apt calculations to list the universities that are within 200 miles of UCLA.
- Obtained the latitude and longitude of each university. Used the haversine formula to calculate the distances using the latitude and longitude. Converted the value to miles and compared. UCLA distance was obtained from DBpedia.
